Airbus IATA fixer by Jiri Kasuba

version: 1.0

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can upload your Airbus airport data (for example mockData), and the fixer will automatically generate and insert random IATA codes for any missing entries. This will save you time when updating the Airbus database.

Correct data format can be seen in the file mockData
